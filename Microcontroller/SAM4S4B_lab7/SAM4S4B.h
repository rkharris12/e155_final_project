 *
 * Top-level device driver for the SAM4S4B microcontroller.
 * 
 * 
 * BACKGROUND INFO:
 * 
 * It is recommended to read the SAM4SB datasheet to understand the peripherals in this device
 * driver: 
 * http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11100-32-bit%20Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM4S_Datasheet.pdf
 * 
 * This device driver was written with a formatting guide of 100 characters per line; it may not 
 * format correctly if viewed in a window that is not sufficiently wide. Some lines (such as the URL
 * above), though few, may exceed this limit as needed.
 * 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT USAGE INFO:
 *
 * This device driver provides minimal working support for the following peripherals:
 *   -- PMC  (Power Management Controller):
 *      -- For clock multiplexing to peripherals and controlling programmable clocks.
 *   -- PIO  (Parallel Input/Output Controller):
 *      -- For peripheral function pin multiplexing and reading/writing digital values from pins. 
 *   -- TC   (Timer Counter):
 *      -- For system delays and counting and triggering at various clock speeds.
 *   -- SPI  (Serial Peripheral Interface):
 *      -- For serial communication with external devices that support SPI.
 *   -- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter):
 *      -- For serial communication with external devices that support UART.
 *   -- PWM  (Pulse Width Modulation Controller):
 *      -- For generating square waves of various frequencies and duty cycles.
 *   -- ADC  (Analog-to-Digital Converter):
 *      -- For reading analog voltages.
 *   -- RTC  (Real Time Clock):
 *      -- For automatic tracking of the time and date.
 *
 * Registers in this file are organized into structs in the following chain:
 *   -- Peripheral Struct (e.g. PCM, SPI) (in the case of PIO and TC, there are multiple)
 *      -- Channel Struct (e.g. TC_CH[k], PWM_CH[k]) (not always defined)
 *         -- Bit Field Struct (of type <Peripheral>_<Register>_bits struct) (not always defined)
 *         -- Register Struct (of type uint32_t struct)
 * The following are examples of how to access members of these structs:
 *   -- Access a register of a peripheral with no channels:
 *      <Peripheral Struct>-><Register Struct>
 *      Example: PIOA->PIO_PER
 *   -- Access a register of a peripheral with channels:
 *      <Peripheral Struct>-><Channel Struct[<Channel Number>]>.<Register Struct>
 *      Example: TC->TC_CH[2].TC_CV
 *   -- Access a bit of a peripheral with no channels:
 *      <Peripheral Struct>-><Bit Field Struct>.<Bit Name>
 *      Example: PMC->PMC_SCER.PCK2
 *   -- Access a bit of a peripheral with channels:
 *      <Peripheral Struct>-><Channel Struct[<Channel Number>]>.<Bit Field Struct>.<Bit Name>
 *      Example: TC->TC_CH.TC_CCR.CLKEN
 *
 * Start your main.c file with the following lines:
 *    #include "SAM4S4B.h"
 *    int main() {
 *        samInit();
 *        // Your code goes here
 *    }
 * 
 * Remember to intialize each peripheral with its init function before using it. (PIO is
 * intialized automatically by any peripheral that uses it, but can still be initialized on its own
 * if it is the only peripheral being used), and enjoy!
 * 
 * 
 * EXTRA INFO:
 * 
 * We use a 40-MHz crystal oscillator to control the clock in Micro Ps, but if you are using the
 * internal oscillator, follow the instructions below:
 * 
 * The main clock for peripherals is rated at 4 MHz but utilizes an RC oscillator, which is cheap
 * and consumes little power but can be inaccurate. As such, it is necessary to verify the clock's
 * frequency. This can be done by running the FPGA clock with samInit():
 *    #include "SAM4S4B.h"
 *    int main() {
 *        samInit();
 *    }
 * Observe pin PIO_PA31 and record its frequency. This will be MCK_FREQ divided by four, so multiply
 * the value by 4 and record this accurate MCK frequency in the #define directive in SAM4S4B_sys.h.
